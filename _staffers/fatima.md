Hi everyone! I am a Junior studying Data Science and Business Administration. I love to hike, cook, thrift, binge-watch tv's/movies (favorites include New Girl, The Office, Arrested Development), and listen to music (loveeee Baby Keem, Taylor Swift, and Banda/Corridos) in my free time. I am excited to meet everyone this semester!
