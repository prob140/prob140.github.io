Hello! I’m a student in the Statistics Department. Currently, I’m conducting research on graph coarsening methods for machine learning and statistical methods for epidemic characterization. I enjoy reading, writing, and learning. Feel free to ask me about classes, research, book recommendations, or anything else!
