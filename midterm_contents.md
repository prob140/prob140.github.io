# Material for the Midterm #
The midterm is during the lecture time on Tuesday October 4. This is a summary of the material for the exam, grouped by main topic. **Boldface** has been reserved for topics that I consider to be **core material** for understanding the rest of the course.

The general techniques are in the sections Probability, Distribution, and Expectation. The next two sections consist of applications. 

In several chapters, the book has sections called Examples. Please review those. Please also review all your homework, labs, quizzes, and exercises done in section.

### Probability ###
- [Chapter 1](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_01/00_Fundamentals.html), Lab 1: Spaces, events, basic counting, exponential approximation
- **[Chapter 2](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_02/00_Calculating_Chances.html): The fundamentals: addition and multiplication rules, conditioning and Bayes' rule**
- [Chapter 5](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_05/00_Collections_of_Events.html): Chances (or bounds on chances) of unions and intersections of several events, with major examples
- [Section 9.1](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_09/01_Probability_by_Conditioning.html): Probabilities by conditioning and recursion 

### Distribution ###

### Expectation ###
- **[Chapter 8](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_08/00_Expectation.html): The main properties, including additivity, the method of indicators, and expectations of functions, as well as the tail sum formula for the expectation of a non-negative integer valued variable**
