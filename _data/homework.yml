### HOMEWORK ORDERING ###
# each entry requires either a 'slug' or a 'title' field

# use the slug if you utilize the _hw collection. this will take info
# from the front matter of the corresponding file in _hw/
# if your filename has a leading zero, quotes are required around the slug.
# if you use the _hw collection, the title field will be useful for
# one-off overrides like holidays or for placeholders; use the title field sparingly

# nonumber supresses the label and numbering for the homework entry
# skip: true will omit the homework from the schedule entirely

# link overrides the default link to the homework page from the collection if 
# you provided a slug or provides an external link
