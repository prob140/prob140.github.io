### LECTURE ORDERING ###
# each entry requires either a 'slug' or a 'title' field

# use the slug if you utilize the _lectures collection. this will take info
# from the front matter of the corresponding file in _lectures/
# if your filename has a leading zero, quotes are required around the slug
# if you use the _lectures collection, the title field will be useful for
# one-off overrides like holidays or for placeholders; use the title field sparingly

# nonumber supresses the label and numbering for the lecture entry
# skip: true will omit the lecture from the schedule entirely

# link overrides the default link to the lecture page from the collection if 
# you provided a slug or provides an external link

# readings appear in the third column of the schedule page. If you have a single reading
# provide title and link. If you have multiple readings, provide a list of links with 
# text and url fields (no title field necessary in this case). You can skip readings by not
# providing the readings field.
