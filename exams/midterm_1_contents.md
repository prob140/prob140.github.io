# Material for Midterm 1 #
#### A. Adhikari ####

Midterm 1 is on Monday 2/12 from 7:10 PM to 8:40 PM. The scope is Chapters 1 through 8. 

Here is a summary of the material for the exam, grouped by main topic. **Boldface** has been reserved for topics that we consider to be **core material** for understanding the rest of the course.

The general techniques are in the sections Probability, Distribution, and Expectation. The Random Counts section consists of applications. 

In several chapters, the book has sections called Examples. Please review those. Please also review all your homework, labs (the mathematical parts), and exercises done in section.

There will be no code on the midterm.

### Probability ###
- [Chapter 1](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_01/00_Fundamentals.html), Lab 1: Spaces, events, basic counting, exponential approximation
- **[Chapter 2](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_02/00_Calculating_Chances.html): The fundamentals: addition and multiplication rules, conditioning and Bayes' rule**
- [Chapter 5](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_05/00_Collections_of_Events.html): Chances (or bounds on chances) of unions and intersections of several events, with major examples 

### Distribution ###
- **[Chapter 3](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_03/00_Random_Variables.html): Random variables, equality versus equality in distribution**
- **[Chapter 4](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_04/00_Relations_Between_Variables.html): Joint, marginals, conditionals, independence**
- [Section 5.3.1](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_05/03_The_Matching_Problem.html#matches-at-fixed-locations) [Section 5.4](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_05/04_Sampling_Without_Replacement.html): Random permutations and symmetry

### Expectation ###
- **[Chapter 8](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_08/00_Expectation.html): The main properties, including additivity, the method of indicators, and expectations of functions (linear and non-linear), as well as the tail sum formula for the expectation of a non-negative integer valued variable**

### Random Counts ###
These distributions are fundamental elements of discrete probabilitistic modeling. **ALL of this section should be in bold.**
